## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I created a basic application using flutter that uses the english words package from pub.dev to randomize word pairs and lets the use scroll through them and add them to a fav selection.

This project helped me in learning a lot about how flutter works fundamentally.It helped me understand the concept of statless and stateful applications.


This is the output and how the app looks :
